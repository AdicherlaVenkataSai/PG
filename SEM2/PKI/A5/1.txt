Man in the middle attack: SSL Strip

To avoid this attack we use HSTS
. once enabled never allows http://
. prevents cookie stealing
. avoids ssl stripping
(a)HSTS allows a site to request that it always be contacted over HTTPS. 
HSTS is supported in google, 
twitter, facebook, Safari,
 Opera, Edge and IE ,
